# GuessThePin Bruteforcer

Welcome to the GuessThePin Bruteforcer repository! This is a small project I forked from [this Replit](https://replit.com/@bobeci6835/spam#main.py) and optimized to run faster, this will guaranteed guess the pin within ~3 mins, depending on hardware it will guess about ~3600 pins per minute or ~60 per second.

## ðŸš€ About Me
I am a beginner developer exploring Python and multithreading. This project helped me learn more about threading, events, and brute-force automation.

## ðŸ“‹ Instructions

To use this script, follow these steps:

1. Press `Win + R`, type `cmd`, and press Enter.
2. Install the required dependency by running:

   ```
3. Download and run the script in Python.
4. The script will attempt to brute-force a PIN on [GuessThePin.com](https://www.guessthepin.com/).
5. When the correct PIN is found, all threads will stop and restart automatically.
